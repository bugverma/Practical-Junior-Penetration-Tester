# Practical-Junior-Penetration-Tester

PEH - Practical Ethical Hacking is a course by TCM Security - Heath Adams ie. The Cyber Mentor. These are my notes for preparation for PNPT (Practical Network Penetration Tester) Certification.

This is one of the many amazing courses by him.

I have decided to make this repository, because:
1. I want to contribute to the community by sharing my learnings & findings.
2. I want to keep myself accountable.
